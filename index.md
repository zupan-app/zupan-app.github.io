## Introduction

I love TikTok and it breaks my heart to see that what makes this project so great is at risk through a ban
or the buy from companies that will transform this place into another marketplace.

With the challenging times ahead of us I think it is crucial that we are the masters of how we want to stay
connected and how we want to share our ideas, enchantments, hard and joyfull times, talents in the making,
unique views on life, etc.

## Some things to discuss

* Visibility for minorities
* Connection for people outside the norm
* Voice for invisible people
* No ban or silencing of indigenous voices
* Proper moderation of content (no hate, no sexualisation of minors)
* Protection for creators to allow removal of their content or sounds
* Pay creators and musicians
* Transparency
