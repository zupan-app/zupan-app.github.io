## What ?

I love *alt* TikTok ðŸ’– and it breaks my heart to see that what makes this project so great is at risk.

I feel that the *alt* TikTok is a happy accident but it is not what TikTok wants to promote. Not now (look at their
front website) and not in the future (see who wants to buy it).

With the challenging times ahead of us I think it is important that we stay connected and share our ideas,
enchantments, hard and joyfull times, talents in the making, unique views on life, etc.

<p class="highlight">We need a place to share real life</p>

## Why ?

The algorithm in this app allows people to connect without having interacted together before and without
even knowing that they would enjoy connecting.

For example, I discovered many videos from disabled people talking about their lives, struggles and unique
perspective on things. Outside of TikTok, I would not even know where to look for these people. The same goes
for members of the LGBTQ+ community, witches, dancers, skaters, makeup artists, tailors,
sculptors, painters, mentally ill people, black lives advocates, body positive people, parents, scientists,
plant lovers, cosplay, musicians, comedians, etc.

We are **incredible** and **diverse** and **beautiful** and we should know about it and nurture this feeling !

<p class="highlight">We need to show our love</p>

## Plan

1. Make a lot of noise !! (**you can help for this NOW !!**)
2. Crowdfunding
3. Non-profit organization
4. Build the app (open source)
5. Enjoy !

## About me

My dream is to dance and sing but I cannot do this right now (transitioning). In August 2020, I had a powerful call
to launch this project. I will lead this project until is it alive... and leave.

I am a Swiss artist, coder and entrepreneur living in the mountains. You can find details here: [lilybucher.com](https://www.lilybucher.com/).

## Values

* Moderation of content (no hate, no sexualisation of minors)
* Protection for creators (allow them to remove their content or sounds, even after duet)
* Fair payment to creators and musicians (maybe add music streaming in-app)
* Transparency (no shadow ban, transparent AI, transparent moderation rules)
* Privacy (cryptography for communication in-app)

## Why "zupan" ?

The name comes from the [mipan zuzuzu](https://www.tiktok.com/foryou?lang=en#/@awa_de_horchata_uwu/video/6849216781303827717) meme. It
also means "love all" (zu pan) in keoda, a constructed language that I am working on.

## Talents needed !

Right now, we need people with connections or experience in creating an app like this one (AI, database, hosting, mobile, video, etc) to
discuss together on how to proceed.
