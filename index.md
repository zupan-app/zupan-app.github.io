## What ?

I love *alt* TikTok ðŸ’– and it breaks my heart to see that what makes this project so great is at risk.

I feel that the *alt* TikTok is a happy accident but it is not what TikTok wants to promote. Not now (look at their
front website) and not in the future (see who wants to buy it).

With the challenging times ahead of us I think it is important that we stay connected and share our ideas,
enchantments, hard and joyfull times, talents in the making, unique views on life, etc.

<p class="highlight">We need a place to share real life</p>

## Why ?

The algorithm in this app allows people to connect without having interacted together before and without
even knowing that they would enjoy connecting.

For example, I discovered many videos from disabled people talking about their lives, struggles and unique
perspective on things. Outside of TikTok, I would not even know where to look for these people. The same goes
for members of the LGBTQ+ community, witches, dancers, skaters, makeup artists, tailors,
sculptors, painters, mentally ill people, black lives advocates, body positive people, parents, scientists,
plant lovers, cosplay, musicians, comedians, etc.

We are **incredible** and **diverse** and **beautiful** and we should know about it and nurture this feeling !

<p class="highlight">We need to show our love</p>

## Plan

1. Make a lot of noise !! (**you can help for this NOW !!**)
2. Crowdfunding
3. Non-profit organization
4. Build the app (open source)
5. Enjoy !

## Why "zupan" ?

The name comes from the [mipan zuzuzu](https://www.tiktok.com/foryou?lang=en#/@awa_de_horchata_uwu/video/6849216781303827717) meme. It
also means "gratitude" (zu pan = love all) in keoda, a constructed language that I am working on.

## Talents needed !

Right now, we need people with connections or experience in creating an app like this one (AI, database, hosting, mobile, video, etc) to
discuss together on how to proceed.
