## What ?

I love *alt* TikTok ðŸ’– and it breaks my heart to see that what makes this project so great is at risk. Whether it is a
ban, the purchase by a big company or the intervention of a state, our content and relations to one another are
not protected.

I also feel that the *alt* TikTok is a happy accident but it is not what TikTok wants to promote. Not now (look at their
front website) and not in the future (see who wants to buy it).

With the challenging times ahead of us I think it is crucial that we master how we want to stay
connected and how we want to share our ideas, enchantments, hard and joyfull times, talents in the making,
unique views on life, etc.

## Why ?

The algorithm in this app allows people to connect without having ever interacted together before and without
even knowing that they would enjoy connecting.

For example, I discovered many videos from disabled people talking about their lives, struggles and unique
perspective on things. Outside of TikTok, I would not even know where to look for these people. The same goes
for members of the LGBTQ+ community, witches, dancers, skaters, makeup artists, tailors,
sculptors, paintors, mentally ill people, black lives advocates, body positive people, parents, scientists,
plant lovers, cosplay, musicians, comedians, etc.

We are **incredible** and **diverse** and **beautiful** and we should know about it and nurture this feeling !

## Plan

1. Gather interest through [@zupan_app](https://www.instagram.com/zupan_app/) on instagram and ideas through the [Google form](https://tinyurl.com/zupan-form)
2. If there is enough interest, create a discord server to discuss the project needs
3. Find a group of people to setup the crowd funding (video, handling, promotion, etc)
4. Crowd funding !
5. Build the app as an open source community project
5. App beta, start hosting content

## My role

My dream is to dance and sing but I cannot do this right now (I am going through gender transition). Since I have
accumulated a lot of experience in software, AI, database and project management through more than 30 years of coding, I thought
maybe I can do one last project before I embrace art as my only job.

I am a Swiss entrepreneur and artist living in the mountains. You can find details on who I am here: [lilybucher.com](https://www.lilybucher.com/)
or on [github](https://github.com/gaspard). I am currently working on [Sarigama](https://www.sarigama-music.com/),
an app for music schools. I have done 20 years of performance art but have removed all this content from the web as it triggers dysphoria.

My goal is to create a non-profit organization managed by the community. I will lead and leave.

## Talents needed !

Right now, we need people with connections or experience in creating an app like this one (AI, database, hosting, mobile, video, etc).

## Values

Here is a list of some these things that we will need to discuss if we want **zupan** to be a better TikTok.

* Proper moderation of content (no hate, no sexualisation of minors)
* Protection for creators to allow removal of their content or sounds
* Proper payment of creators and musicians (maybe add music stream in-app)
* Transparency (no shadow ban, transparent AI, transparent moderation rules)
* Cryptography (private communication in-app)

## Why "zupan" ?

The name comes from the [mipan zuzuzu](https://www.tiktok.com/foryou?lang=en#/@awa_de_horchata_uwu/video/6849216781303827717) meme. It
also means "love all" (zu pan) in keoda, a constructed language that I am working on.
