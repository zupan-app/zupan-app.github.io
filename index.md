## What ?

I love TikTok ðŸ’– and it breaks my heart to see that what makes this project so great is at risk. Whether it is a
ban, the purchase by a big company or the intervention of a state, our content and relations to one another are
not protected.

With the challenging times ahead of us I think it is crucial that we master how we want to stay
connected and how we want to share our ideas, enchantments, hard and joyfull times, talents in the making,
unique views on life, etc.

## Why ?

The algorithm in this app allows people to connect without having ever interacted together before and without
even knowing that they would enjoy connecting.

For example, I discovered many videos from disabled people talking about their lives, struggles and unique
perspective on things. Outside of TikTok, I would not even know where to look for these people. The same goes
for members of the LGBTQ+ community, witches, dancers, skaters, makeup artists, tailors,
sculptors, paintors, mentally ill people, black lives advocates, body positive people, parents, scientits,
plant lovers, cosplay, etc.

We are **incredible** and **diverse** and **beautiful** and we should know about it and nurture this feeling !

## Some things to discuss

* Visibility for minorities
* Connection for people outside the norm
* Voice for invisible people
* No ban or silencing of indigenous voices
* Proper moderation of content (no hate, no sexualisation of minors)
* Protection for creators to allow removal of their content or sounds
* Pay creators and musicians
* Transparency

## Why "zupan"

The name comes from the "mipan zuzuzu" meme. It also means "love all" (zu pan) in keoda, a constructed language.
